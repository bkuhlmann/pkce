= Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)

‚ÄºÔ∏è *This gem is deprecated and will be fully destroyed on 2026-01-15. There is no replacement. Please update accordingly.* ‚ÄºÔ∏è

Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) is an authorization code flow extension to link:https://oauth.net[OAuth] which is necessary for mobile authentication but works well for web flows because the added security is transparent to the user. Specifically, PKCE prevents the following types of attacks:

* Authorization code interception
* Authorization code injection

This gem is an implementation of the {rfc_link} specification so you can leverage PKCE in your own code.

toc::[]

== Features

- Implements the {rfc_link} specification.
- Provides a simple object API for obtaining a challenge and verify code.
- Provides max length security by default.
- Answers a monad result.

== Requirements

. link:https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby].
. link:https://www.oauth.com[OAuth].

== Setup

To install _with_ security, run:

[source,bash]
----
# üí° Skip this line if you already have the public certificate installed.
gem cert --add <(curl --compressed --location https://alchemists.io/gems.pem)
gem install pkce --trust-policy HighSecurity
----

To install _without_ security, run:

[source,bash]
----
gem install pkce
----

You can also add the gem directly to your project:

[source,bash]
----
bundle add pkce
----

Once the gem is installed, you only need to require it:

[source,ruby]
----
require "pkce"
----

== Usage

The object API is simple to work with as you only need to interact with the `PKCE` constant. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
code = PKCE.call.success
code.challenge  # e2tGChTfGON-C55i0yu13-urIgDFuMCmo73F7TZmoiw
code.verify     # hYnx2WTJo7Bgu1-GqPUIYtRkb2W7pRBawkmdDi3omPdramb27Fp4rps_w6ozns-gbVCKFC2-Kno4P_b1H3FuxnlYIOd9Bo5yoTXq_xEHDJaB_fOfn2NaiCtcWQ8Bs91I
----

You can also pass in a custom length (default is maximum):

[source,ruby]
----
code = PKCE.call(length: 35).success
code.challenge  # R1b1Ka3jmrLKvQ7xW5QmP5MsCSEWtdoA2lo3r-SZDfg
code.verify     # ucKkqwoMzc9cyPcSGMbuVf3ivr4sep2mq15hGN9sVzl4X7g
----

In case of a failure, you'll get a proper error message:

[source,ruby]
----
PKCE.call(length: 100).failure  # Invalid PKCE verifier length: 100. Must be between 32..96.
----

Due to the fact that PKCE answers back a link:https://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-monads[monad], you have all of the power of link:https://alchemists.io/talks/ruby_pattern_matching[pattern matching] at your fingertips as well:

[source,ruby]
----
include Dry::Monads[:result]

case PKCE.call
  in Success(code) then puts code.inspect
  in Failure(message) then puts message
end
----

Finally, since the code answered back is a link:https://alchemists.io/articles/ruby_data[Data] object that you can easily test and interact with:

[source,ruby]
----
PKCE.call.success
#<data PKCE::Code challenge="ROMnfvHt04xhM80WB2PyPK67GGrG35UdFEf0DEBkes0", verify="cUq917cDIROAUkew-OjIdfIz1OYyv-ERt9NnSdzlxz4XSYzdbRycVuRDD2SBIDBiKnXUamxvpxNRsUMBQ1PvBdtziGs_oYe98MDWmM8J2_NJQBVg2kP-B2OqBdMp00qh">
----

== Development

To contribute, run:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/bkuhlmann/pkce
cd pkce
bin/setup
----

You can also use the IRB console for direct access to all objects:

[source,bash]
----
bin/console
----

=== Architecture

The following documents the workflow used to process and build authorization codes.
